* Name: prelude.rs
* Description: A prelude module is a common Rust pattern used to re-export frequently used
	items (such as structs, traits, functions, and macros) from a module or crate. This allows
	users to import a single prelude module to gain access to a set of commonly used items,
	simplifying the import process and improving code readability.
